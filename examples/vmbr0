# This is an example "kitchen sink" setup for bridged VM networking on "vmbr0".
#
# YOU WILL WANT TO EDIT THIS TO SUIT YOUR SYSTEM.
#
# The host is given the address 10.11.0.1/24, and dnsmasq (from dnsmasq-base)
# is used to provide DHCP and DNS service for the "vmbr0" TLD.
# Virtual machines will be assigned DNS names based solely on their MAC
# address, e.g.  12-00-00-ab-cd-ef.vmbr0.
# IP masquerading is enabled for "vmbr0" via the "enp0s25" outgoing interface.
# It is assumed that the host is running "unbound" as its resolver, with
# unbound-control enabled, and suitable forward zones are added to make DNS
# resolution for "vmbr0" work from the host.
# The "vmbr0-master" interface is created in order to work around the stupid
# Linux behaviour of the bridge interface taking on the MAC address of the
# first-connected slave interface. You may want to change the MAC address used.
